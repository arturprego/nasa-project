Study of nasa asteroids data

This project aims to provide a framework on how to derive data insights from nasa asteroids data.
Extraction is done on python, transformation on dbt, using a bigquery database.
It was created with the purpose of learning and making the best use possible of this technologies. So all feedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Improvements to do:

Python: 
 - Making the code more robust to failure
 - Proper logging
 
dbt:
 - Improved models and segmentations
 - Proper testing and documentation
 
 
Visualization
 - To be added
